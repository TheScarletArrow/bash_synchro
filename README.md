This is my attempt tp make bash file which:
compares two directories and synchronizes 'em
it copies files which are not in the other directory
and replaces the older version with newer if both files exist

To start the program just type its name, then choose the 2nd in menu
or you can copy this file and set your own directories by default

If you have any auggestions - I am free to hear them
