# bashone
# This is my attempt to make bash file for lab work
# It is currently in progress
# my goal is to syncronise two paths
# path 1 and path 2
# path 1 and 2 can be anywhere on PC 
# or external storage device
# you can set the paths by yourself
# by defaults are working too
# but you need to set the right directory
