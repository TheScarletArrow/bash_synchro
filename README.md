# bashone
# This is my attempt to make bash file for lab work
# It is currently in progress
# my goal is to syncronise two paths
# path 1 and path 2
# from my point of view there are 2 ways
# 1st is when file is on PC but not on flash drive - then we just copy it to flash
# 2nd is when we have these files both on PC and flash, we need to find out wheter is newer, and replace the older
